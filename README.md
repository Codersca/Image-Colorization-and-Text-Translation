# Image Colorization, Text Extraction & Translation

This project demonstrates an end-to-end pipeline that performs the following tasks:

1. **Colorizes grayscale images** using a custom convolutional neural network built with PyTorch.
2. **Extracts text** from the colorized image using Keras-OCR.
3. **Translates** the extracted text into Hindi using the `translate` Python library.
